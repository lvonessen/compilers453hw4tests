Put hello0 in str[0-5] and print:
Hello
Put 'w' in str[6]
Should be 'H' and 'o':
str[0] = 72:72:H
str[4] = 111:111:o
str[] is now 'Hello0w' (so it should print 'Hello')
Hello
These characters should still be 'l' and 'o':
str[3] = 108:108:l
str[4] = 111:111:o
Still Hello: Hello
And finally...
Hello world!
